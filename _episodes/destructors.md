title: "Destructors"
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is a destructor?"
objectives:
- "Create a destructor for our two derived types to deallocate memory."
keypoints:
- "A destructor is used to perform clean up when an object goes out of scope."
- "To create a destructor use the **final** keyword when declaring at type bound procedure instead of the procedure keyword."

One aspect I have been ignoring until now is that the memory we allocate for our vectors is never explicitly freed by our program. So far our program has been simple enough that this is not a serious issue. We have only created a few objects that allocate memory within our main program. When the program execution has completed, that memory is returned to the operating system. However, if we had a long running loop inside our program that created new objects with allocated memory and we never deallocated that memory we would have a problem as our program would steadily increase its memory usage. This is referred to as a memory leak as was mentioned in the first half of this workshop. We can manually deallocate memory as we did with allocating memory before we created a function to create new `t_vector` and `t_vector_3` objects, however there is a way to create a new special type bound procedure that is automatically called with the object goes out of scope to deallocate this memory for us. To do this we use the **final** keyword within the type definition.

~~~
type <type-name>
  ...
  contains
  final:: <type-finalization-subroutine>
end type
~~~
{: .fortran}

Then as we did for the `display` subroutine, we can create a `<type-finalization-subroutine>` to do anything that needs to be done when an object of this type goes out of scope, including deallocating memory.

Lets add destructors to deallocate our memory for our two derived types.
